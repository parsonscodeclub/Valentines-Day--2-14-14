Valentines-Day--2-14-14
=======================

the demo we did on valentine's day.

#Intro

1. I'm using Sublime Text with [Emmet](http://emmet.io) so I'll be autocompleting *a lot*.
2. I don't expect you to follow along or memorize anything, this is just supposed to be to let you know that these things exist / to get the hang of certain concepts.
3. This README will serve as a repository for help and references so if you wish to actually implement these things on your own, you can!
